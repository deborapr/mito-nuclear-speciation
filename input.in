T = number of generations
N = pop size
L1 and L2 = sides of the rectangle, L1 >= L2
mut = nuclear mutation rate
mut-mit = mitochondrial mutation rate
diff = diffusion coefficient
qmat = model parameter (reproduction phase)
S = radius of the mating neighborhood
G = genetic threshold for reproduction
B = nuclear genome size
BM = mitochondrial genome size


INISBIT 0 = random position
INISBIT 1 = localized
IREAD = 0 --starts new run
IREAD = 1 --read a file pop-someting.dat and continues from there
nmax = maximum population size
nmax = 0 -> maximum is N
iini, ifin, jini, jfin = coordinates for localized distribution of individuals
